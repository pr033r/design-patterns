All the content is based on great and perfect explaining book :open_book: [Navrhove Vzory](https://www.databazeknih.cz/knihy/navrhove-vzory-10930).
I highly recommend to buy and read this book if you want to get more skills in the programming.

All Design Patterns are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html) language. I found it as very common and
useful language (it's also Java - but currently most of the development I do is based on TS).
Moreover, TS as a JS are one on the most used programming languages on the world - it could be
run also on the Backend as well as Frontend environment. More and more employers are searching
for JavaScript/TypeScript developers, so I think it's a good choice why I've selected the TS.

To compile all TypeScript files run
``tsc`` command and all translated code will be stored in the ``/build`` folder. If you want to
configure the TypeScript settings, go to the ``tsconfig.json`` file.

Every design-pattern has own directory and all the action can be run from the **index.html** where's 
the particular *action-button*. Output is mostly written in the output console so don't forget 
to press the ``F12`` button to show the standard console output.

Enjoy! :suspect:
